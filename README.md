# Recipe-finder

This project is a Recipe Finder implemented using Vue.js, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The goal is to allow users to search for recipes by entering different keywords such as ingredients, type of cuisine, mix of ingredients, proteins, or categories. My primary objective was to practice API interaction and integrate it with Axios.

## Features

- **Recipe Search:** Find recipes by ingredients, cuisine type, or categories.
- **Responsive Design:** Adaptable layout for different screen sizes.
- **API Integration:** Fetching data from recipe APIs using Axios.
- **User-friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive design for easy navigation.

## Future Improvements

- **Accessibility Enhancements:** Make the application more accessible to all users (currently in progress).
- **Vue Router Integration:** Implement Vue Router for better navigation and routing.
- **Show More Button:** Complete the configuration of the 'Show More' button for additional recipes.
- **Favorites Feature:** Allow users to select and save their favorite recipes.
